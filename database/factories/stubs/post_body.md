Far far away, [behind the word mountains](https://example.com/), far from the countries **Vokalia** and **Consonantia**, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to

2nd paragraph. *italic*, **bold**, ~~strikethrought~~ and `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

* this one ~~strikethrought~~
* that one `monospace`
* the other one *italic*
* last one **bold**

> Block quotes are written like so.

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if
you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~

### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

    * carrots
    * celery
    * lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

       find wooden spoon
       uncover pot
       stir
       cover pot
       balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
       wait 10 minutes
       goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

   Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including that last line which continues item 3 above).
